Unpack the archives inside your `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/python3.9/site-packages/package-name/` folders so that you overwrite the previous contents.

For instance for `distributed`, unpack and overwrite the old files in:
```bash
${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/python3.9/site-packages/distributed-2021.4.0-py3.9.egg/
```
For `jtop` unpack and overwrite in:
```bash
${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/python3.9/site-packages/jtop/
```
